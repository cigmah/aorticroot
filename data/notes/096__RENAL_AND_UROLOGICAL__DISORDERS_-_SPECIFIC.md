## Hyponatraeamia

**Hyponatraemia** is defined as a **serum sodium (Na+) < 135 mmol/L**. Symptoms
include nausea, vomiting, lethargy; if severe (< 120mmol/L), can cause seizures,
coma or death. It is most often caused by either:
  1. An increase in circulating ADH (aka vasopressin), or
  2. An increase in kidneys' sensitivity to ADH. 

If you see a patient with hyponatraemia:

1. **Determine if the patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic or hypervolaemic.**
   Hyponatraemia is a *water balance* problem; serum sodium doesn't reflect
   total body sodium, and patients may actually have a net excess in total body
   sodium while having a low serum sodium. Therefore, *always consider
   hyponatraemia in the context of volume status* - you don't fix hyponatraemia
   by pumping in more sodium!

If it is **hypovolaemic hyponatraemia**:

1. **Your patient is dehydrated**. The problem is because the patient is losing
   fluid and salts.
2. **Measure urinary sodium**  to help narrow down the underlying cause.
   1. If the urinary sodium is normal (<20mmol/L), then the cause is probably
      non-renal, so the patient is likely losing fluids and salts through GI
      loss (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea) or skin losses (burns, sweating). 
   2. If the urinary sodium is high (>20mmol/L), then the patient is losing
      salts excessively through the kidneys. This could be from adrenal
      insufficiency/Addison's disease, diuretics or other osmotic diureses. 
3. **Replenish volume, usually with normal saline.**. The patient is dehydrated,
   so you fix the dehydration with isotonic crystalloid - be very wary of
   hypertonic solutions. ADH will have been high prior to fluid replenishment
   (especially if they were chronically dehydrated) and will fall once you
   correct fluids, so you need to be careful not to overcorrect (because the
   sodium will rapidly rise once the ADH falls).
   
If it is **euvolaemic hyponatraemia**:

1. **It is probably the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH).** SIADH
   can be caused by a whole range of underlying disorders (e.g. malignancy,
   tumours, infection, drugs), so you should find and treat the underlying
   disorder.
   
If it is **hypervolaemic hyponatraemia**:

1. **Your patient is congested.** This is usually due to an oedematous disorder
   (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), where the patient
   retains fluid out of proportion to sodium. The effective arterial blood
   volume is actually usually decreased (e.g. from cardiac dysfunction,
   vasodilation), so a pathophysiology similar to hypovolaemic hyponatraemia
   occurs with ADH increasing due to activation of the
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
2. **Manage the underlying disorder**.
