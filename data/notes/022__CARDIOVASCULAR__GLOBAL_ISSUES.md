## How much does cardiovascular disease contribute to disease burden in Australia?

In Australia, cardiovascular diseases as a group accounted for **14%** of total
disease burden (measured in DALYs) in the [2015 Australian Burden of Disease
Study](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/burden-of-disease/burden-disease-study-illness-death-2015/contents/summary),
second only to cancer (18%). Most of the burden due to cardiovascular diseases
is from fatal burden (78.5%) rather than non-fatal burden (21.5%). 
Cardiovascular disease burden is more highly represented in men (15.2% of total
burden, ranked 2nd) than in women (11.7% of total burden, ranked 4th). The
proportion of burden from cardiovascular diseases increases during late life and
contributes a large portion of disease burden due to aging.

  |------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
  | 1    | Cancer                           | 18%                                   |

When disease burden is broken down into individual diseases, **coronary heart
disease** emerges as the *leading* cause of total disease burden out of the
individual diseases which were analysed, contributing 6.9% of total disease
burden (compared with the next leading cause, *back pain & problems*
contributing 4.1%).

## How much does cardiovascular disease contribute to disease burden globally?

Globally, cardiovascular diseases as a group accounted for **15%** of total
disease burden (measured in DALYs) according to [2016 disease burden and
mortality estimates by the
WHO](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/index1.html),
the largest disease group with the next largest group, *infectious and parasitic
diseases*, coming in at 12%. This is a marked shift from 2000 estimates when
cardiovascular disease accounted for 12% of total disease burden, and infectious
and parasitic diseases accounted for 21%.

On an individual disease level, *ischaemic heart disease* (7.6%) and
*stroke* (5.2%) were the two diseases which contributed the highest proportion to
global disease burden, with *lower respiratory infections* (4.9%) trailing in
third.
