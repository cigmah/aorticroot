      <p>
        The <b>neural plate</b> is a piece of thickened <b>ectodermal</b> tissue which later becomes the nervous system. It is induced by the underlying <b>notochord</b> and appears at roughly the beginning of the third week of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The neural plate margins will eventually lift and converge to form the <b>neural tube</b> through a process known as <b>primary neurulation</b>.

      <p>
        <b>Primary neurulation</b> is the process in which the <b>neural plate</b> forms the <b>neural tube</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step-by-step:
        <ol>
          <li>The edges of the neural plate thicken into <b>neural folds</b>.</li>
          <li>The centre of the neural plate depresses into the <b>neural groove</b>.</li>
          <li>The neural folds elevate and move towards the midline while the neural groove further depresses, forming an invagination.</li>
          <li>The neural folds converge and close off the invagination, forming a <b>neural tube</b> below the overlying epidermis. <b>Neural crest cells</b> form at the junction between the neural tube and epidermis.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Closure of the neural tube typically occurs first cranially, then caudally.

## Neural Tube Defects

**Neural tube defects** refer to disorders related to incomplete closure of the neural tube during primary neurulation.

    <td>
      <p>
        <b>Anencephaly</b> refers to absence of parts of the brain or skull.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anencephaly occurs because of a failure of the <b>cranial</b> portion of the neural tube to close during primary neurulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Etymology derives from <i>an-</i> (absence) and <i>enkephalos</i> (brain).

      Spina bifida
    </th>
    <td>
      <p>
        <b>Spina bifida</b> refers to a range of defects where the spinal cord is exposed, or the structures surrounding the spinal cord fail to enclose it properly. Typically, this occurs at the lumbosacral region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spina bifida occurs because of a failure of the <b>caudal</b> portion of the neural tube to close during primary neurulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Etymology from <i>spina</i> (spine) and <i>bifida</i> (split), possibly referring to the gap in the spinal vertebra produced by the malformation.

      Types of spina bifida

      <p>
        Spina bifida ranges in severity and is therefore often classified into different types:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Spina bifida occulta</b>, which refers to a malformation of the surrounding bony vertebra. The overlying skin is intact (<i>occulta</i> referring to "hidden"). The overlying skin may sometimes be marked with a <b>sacral dimple</b> or <b>tuft of hair</b>.</li>
          <li><b>Meningocoele</b>, where only the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid herniate through the defect (<i>meningo</i> referring to meninges, and <i>-coele</i> referring to cavity or chamber). Overlying skin may or may not be intact. </li>
          <li><b>Myelomeningocoele</b>, where a portion of the spinal cord herniates through the defect (<i>myelo</i> referring to marrow or spinal cord).</li>
        </ul>
