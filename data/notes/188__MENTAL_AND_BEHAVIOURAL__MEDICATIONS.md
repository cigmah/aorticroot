# Benzodiazepines

# Opioids

*Opioids** are drugs which act at opioid receptors (mu, kappa or delta) and
produce analgesic, euphoric and depressive effects. 

**Endogenous opioids** are molecules found naturally in the brain which interact with
opioid receptors. 

**Opioid receptors** come in three flavours:

1. **Mu** opioid receptors, which are the main target of most opioid agonists
   (think *M* for *morphine*). 
2. **Kappa** opioid receptors.
3. **Delta** opioid receptors.

**Opioid agonists**, such as **morphine** and **methadone**, are used for their
analgesic effects. 

**Partial opioid agonists**, such as **buprenorphine**, bind selectively to
opioid receptors but don't trigger as many downstream effects. 

**Opioid antagonists**, such as **naltrexone** or **naloxone**, are used as an
opioid overdose antidote.
