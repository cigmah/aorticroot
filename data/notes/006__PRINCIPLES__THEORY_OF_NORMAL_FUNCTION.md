# Physiology

*Physiology* is the study of the human body functions (usually in the "normal"
state, rather than when disease makes things go wrong).

# Cellular Physiology

Here are some key definitions:

- **Passive transport** describes a natural movement of molecules across
  membranes. *No additional energy* is required; molecules move naturally in
  whatever direction increases entropy (e.g. from high concentration to low
  concentration, to equalise a concentration gradient). 
     - There are *four types of passive transport*:
       1. **(Simple) diffusion**
       2. **Facilitated diffusion**
       3. **Filtration**
       4. **Osmosis**
- **Active transport** describes a purposeful movement of molecules across
  membranes. *Energy is required* because molecules are often moving in ways
  which decrease entropy (e.g. from low concentration to high concentration, to
  accumulate a molecule). 

## Cellular Components

Here are some of the functional features of the components of cells:

- The **plasma membrane** is the outer protective lining of cells.
  - Passively, it is:
   - **Impermeable** to large molecules (so proteins and genetic material usually stay inside).
   - **Selectively permeable** to small molecules (so some ions can cross)
  - But cells are complex, and having molecules pass through passively down
    concentration gradients is not enough for most cells (e.g. cells need to
    import/export proteins or build up ions).
