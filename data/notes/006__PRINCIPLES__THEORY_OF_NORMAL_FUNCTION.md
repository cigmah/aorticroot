# Physiology

*Physiology* is the study of the human body functions (usually in the "normal"
state, rather than when disease makes things go wrong).

# Homeostasis

The human body is churning away every day. It maintains itself. It's able to do
so because all of the processes in the human body maintain a very fine balance
that's self-regulating and self-tuning like a thermostat. This is the principle
of *homeostasis*, or how the body is able to keep itself in a physical and
chemical balance. 

There are lots of different components in the human body, and each needs to be
kept in a fine balance through homeostatic mechanisms so you can live every day
in a similar fashion. 

## Feedback

Balance is achieved by simultaneously having *control* over variables in the
body (e.g. temperature), and by being able to *sense* those variables. 

By continually maintaining a *loop* of controlling something, sensing the
effect, adjusting control, sensing the effect etc, the body is able to maintain
*feedback loops*  which help it to readjust its control. 

The effect of feedback is often divided into two types:

1. *Positive feedback*, which is when an increase in a variable causes the
   controller to change to continue to increase the variable. During ovulation,
   for example, rising levels of oestrogen trigger a positive feedback loop with
   lutenising hormone (LH), which continues to increase both hormones until the
   egg is released.
2. *Negative feedback*,
