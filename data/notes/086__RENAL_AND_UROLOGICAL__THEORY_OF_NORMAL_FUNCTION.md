## Body Fluids

### How much of the body is fluid?

As a general rule, fluids make up roughly **60% of total body weight (TBW)**.
Women tend to have slightly less fluid than men due to a higher relative
proportion of fat (but clearly this is a generalisation!), according to
[Anaesthesia MCQ](https://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl2_1.php).

The key takeaway is that *most of the body is made up of fluid.*

### How is fluid in the body distributed?

The fluids in the body are divided into *fluid compartments*, which describe the
"separated" areas where fluid is distributed. 

- **Fluid compartments** are divisions of fluid around the body.
  - Traditionally, these compartments are:
    - **Extracellular fluid, comprising ~1/3** of fluids in the body. 
    - **Intracellular fluid, comprising ~2/3** of fluids in the body.

The exact numbers vary, but the key takeaway is that *most of the fluid in the
body is stored within cells.*

### What parts of the body are considered *extracellular fluid*?

**Extracellular fluid** refers to fluid outside of cells, and includes:

1. **Interstitial fluid**, which is fluid within tissues that "bathes" and
   surrounds cells. Cells are separated from interstitial fluid by their plasma
   membrane. This is the largest component.
2. **Intravascular fluid (i.e. blood plasma)**, which is the fluid component of
   the blood that travels in your arteries and veins.
3. **Transcellular fluid**, which refers to small pockets of fluid usually in
   compartmentalised spaced, such as the CSF, synovial fluid and vitreous humor.
   
The key takeaway is that *extracellular fluid can be interstitial,
intravascular, or transcellular - but most of it is interstitial*.

## Movement of Fluids Across Membranes

### What's osmolarity, what's tonicity, and what's the difference? (bonus: what's osmolality?)
