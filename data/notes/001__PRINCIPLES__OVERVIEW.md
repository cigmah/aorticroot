# What's this?

Welcome to AORTA. This grid item doesn't correspond to any specific medical
knowledge per-se, but will help orient you to the specialty and topics of the
grid.

In general, the **Principles** row of the grid will introduce you to general
principles relevant to a topic. The **Overview** column of the grid will give a
broad overview of the topic coverage of each specialty. 

Each grid item contains a main note which is contributed by volunteers, as well
as questions attached to the grid item. If you are logged in, you can also add
EMQs and public contributions to each grid item. 

We hope you find AORTA useful for revising for assessments. If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to get in contact with us on the Info tab.
