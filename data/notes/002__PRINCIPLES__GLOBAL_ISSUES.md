# EPIDEMIOLOGY

## What is epidemiology?

[According to the WHO, **epidemiology** is the study of "the distribution and
determinants of health-related states or
events"](https://www.who.int/topics/epidemiology/en/). Health is a global
phenomena, and our health is influenced by the events going on around us. It's
important to understand how non-biomedical factors contribute to health; these
factors may go unintentionally neglected, and often exert a strong effect on our
state of wellbeing.

# HEALTH IN SOCIETY

## "HEALTH"

### What is health?

The [constitution of the
WHO](http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/constitution-en.pdf?ua=1) states that:

> Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not
> merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

This definition is somewhat controversial. These are discussed in greater depth
in [*How should we define health?* (Huber et al
2011)](https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4163). 

Many of the issues are with the word *complete*, which is overly restrictive and
imprecise. Is being sad unhealthy? What blood pressure threshold is unhealthy
enough to merit intervention? Are patients with chronic illness permanently
unhealthy?

In response, Huber et al. propose an alternative definition of health as:

> The ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of social, physical and
> emotional challenges. 

### Is health a human right?

Yes. The second statement of the [constitution of the
WHO](http://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/constitution-en.pdf?ua=1), right
after the definition of health, states that:

> The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of
> the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of
> race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.

### What is necessary for health?

The [Ottawa Charter for Health
Promotion](https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/ottawa/en/),
developed at the First International Conference on Health Promotion in Ottawa in
1986, defines the following pre-requisites for health:

> - peace,
> - shelter,
> - education,
> - food,
> - income,
> - a stable eco-system,
> - sustainable resources,
> - social justice, and equity.

Notice that hospitals, clinics and medical personnel aren't on the list. The
Ottawa Charter emphasises that the responsibility for health is not solely in
the domain of the healthcare sector, but shared between the many forces which
affect our daily living. We cannot expect patients to enjoy good health if they
are stricken between poverty, war or starvation; no amount of medical management
can fix that.
