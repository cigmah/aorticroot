## UNSW Embryology

The [UNSW Embryology
website](https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Main_Page) is
fantastic resource with comprehensive embryology information. It can be quite
information-heavy, but is a great point of reference.

## Fertilisation

**Fertilisation** is when sperm and egg unite to form a **zygote** **- i.e. when the
two *haploid* gametes (23 chromosomes each) combine to form a *diploid* cell
which is the start of a new human being. At this point, the egg and sperm are
still free in the uterine tube. 

### Zona Pellucida 

The [zona
pellucida](https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Zona_pellucida)
is a glycoprotein-rich coating around human egg. The sperm cell needs to
breach this coating in order to fuse with the egg. 

### Acrosome Reaction

When a sperm cell approaches the egg, sperm surface proteins interact with the
zona pellucida and initiate the **acrosome reaction**. The *acrosome* is a
coating on the head of the sperm. It contains enzymes which are released in the
acrosome reaction to break down the zona pellucida so it can penetrate and fuse
with the egg.

## Zygote

The zygote is the cell at the start of huamn life which contains a *full set of
chromosomes* (it's the combination of the egg and sperm, so it has 46
chromosomes).
