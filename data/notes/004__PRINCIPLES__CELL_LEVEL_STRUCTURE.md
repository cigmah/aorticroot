# Cells

A *cell* is the basic structural unit of organisms. We're made up of lots of
cells. Importantly, it's a very broad umbrella term - the cells of the human
body differ enormously and are all specialised for different purposes.

Despite having the same essential structure, different types of cell (such as
red blood cells, neurons, hepatocytes and myocytes) have many individual special
features which make them great workers at their job.

# Organelles

*Organelles* are structures within cells which perform specific functions. Most
cells are highly specialised, so the function of cells' organelles are best
understood in the context of what cell type it is, but some functions of
organelles you might later come across include:

## Genetic Material

- *Nucleus* - the organelle containing the genetic material of a cell (DNA),
  which encodes instructions for the cell to produce its proteins. All cells
  have a nucleus except for *red-blood cells* (which discard their nucleus) and
  *platelets* (which are flecks of cytoplasm from larger nucleated cells called
  *megakaryocytes*).
  
## Energy

- *Mitochondria* - "the powerhouse of the cell". Makes energy so the cell can
  actually do its work. 
  
## Synthesis

- *Rough endoplasmic reticulum* - an organelle embedded with *ribosomes* which
  are involved in protein synthesis.
- *Smooth endoplasmic reticulum* - an organelle with varied functions such as
  steroid hormone synthesis, lipid synthesis and other metabolic roles.
- *Golgi apparatus* - an organelle which processes and packages proteins into
  vesicles so they can be sent away. Many cells produce products that are
  secreted, going through the Golgi apparatus. 
  
## Clean-Up

- *Peroxisome* - an organelle containing reducers which assist in metabolic
  processing and metabolising foreign products.
- *Lysosome* - an organelle containing enzymes which process and degrade waste
  products
  
## Structural Integrity

- *Cytosol* - the gel-like liquid filling the cell, in which the cell activity
  (e.g. metabolic activity)
- *Microtubules* - structural protein cylinders that hold the cell shape and
  guide molecules. 
- *Microfilaments* - proteins which assist cell contraction (esp. in myocytes,
  or muscle cells) and maintain shape. 
  
## Projection-Like Structures

- *Microvilli* - thin finger-like extensions of plasma membrane which promote
  absorption, e.g. in the gut lining. 
- *Cilia* - thin hair-like, often-motile organelles which help "beat" particles
  along paths, e.g. in the upper respiratory tract (to sweep mucus and debris).
- *Flagella** - thin, whip-like motile projections which help move the cell
  around, e.g. in sperm and some infectious pathogens. 
  
  
# Tissue

*Tissues* are collections of cells which have a common function. Tissues are
usually classified as one of:

- *Epithelial* - coverings and interfaces, often *avascular*, involved in
  protection, secretion and absorption. 
- *Connective* - meshes, involved in holding things together and providing
  structural support. 
- *Muscular* - movers, involved in moving whatever it's connected to by
  contracting as a group. 
- *Nervous* - communication wires, involved in transmitting electrochemical
  signals around the body to tell cells what to do.
