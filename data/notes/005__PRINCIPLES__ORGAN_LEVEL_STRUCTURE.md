# Gross Anatomy

*Gross anatomy* is the study of anatomy at the level of organs, rather than
individual cells. 

Your teaching in gross anatomy will typically start with the upper and lower
limbs, for which you can order your thinking by the various components of the
limbs - the bones, the muscles, the joints, the vessels and the nerves (and the
connective tissue holding it all together).

You'll then start to learn about the organs and their individual anatomy. A
similar process of thinking about bones (if relevant), muscle, joints, vessels
and nerves will be helpful. 

# Anatomical Terminology

## Axes 

There are three primary axes we refer to when talking about the relation of
structures relative to each other in the human body. These axes are always
defined relative to a human standing in a neutral position with their palms
facing in the same direction as their face (in front of them).

- *Superior* and *inferior* refer to positions along the *longitudinal* axis.
  The brain is *superior* to the heart (above), and the heart is *inferior* to
  the brain (below). 
- *Anterior*/*ventral*/*plantar* and *posterior*/*dorsal* refer to positions along the
  *sagittal* axis. The toes are *anterior* (in front of) to the ankle, and the
  ankle is *posterior* (behind) the toes. *Ventral* and *dorsal* are often used
  when talking about the palms (*ventra*) vs the back of the hand (*dorsal*), or
  the sole of the foot (*ventral*/*plantar*) vs the top of the foot (*dorsal*).
- *Medial* and *lateral* refer to positions along the *horizontal* axis. The
  nose is *medial* (closer to the midline) to the ears, and the ears are
  *lateral* (further from the midline) to the nose. 

## Planes

Sections of the body (e.g. when taking a CT-scan) are also often referred to by
the plane in which the section is taking. There are three primary body planes.

- *Sagittal* - "back to front". Comes from the Latin word for "arrow" - think of an
  arrow travelling straight through your body shot by Sagittarius!
- *Coronal* - "left to right".
- *Transverse* - "top to bottom".
