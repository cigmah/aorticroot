# Gross Anatomy

### In what order do I study anatomy?

You can study anatomy through a number of approaches which highlight different
anatomical patterns:

- **Regional approaches**, where you study anatomy by different anatomical
  locations around the body (e.g. the head, the neck, the thorax, the abdomen,
  the upper limb).
- **Systemic approaches**, where you study anatomy by the different body systems
  (e.g. the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system).

## Anatomical Terminology

### How do I describe the positions of structures relative to one another?

For consistency, relations of anatomical structures are usually made with
reference to humans positioned in a *standard anatomical position*.

- **(Standard) anatomical position (of reference)** is a standard positioning of
  the body from which anatomical relations are described. For humans, this
  usually corresponds to standing straight with the palms facing outward.

You can talk about axes and terms describing relations along those axes.

- **Axes** are lines of reference to talk about positions of structures relative
  to one another. There are examples of these lines below, but any line parallel
  to these lines is also considered as that axis. 
  - The **longitudinal axis** is a line from your head to your feet.
      - Your head is **superior/cranial** (above) to our feet. 
      - Your feet are **inferior/caudal** (below) to your head.
  - The **sagittal axis** is a line from the front of your chest to the back of
    your back (think sagittal = sagittarius = an arrow through your chest).
      - Your toes are **anterior** (in front of) your heel.
      - Your heel is **posterior** (behind) your toes.
      - Your palm is **ventral** (more palm-facing, like anterior) to the back of your hand.
      - The back of your hand is **dorsal** (more back-facing, like posterior)
        to your palm.
  - The **horizontal axis** is a line from your left ear to your right ear.
      - Your ears are **lateral** (further out from the midline) to your nose.
      - Your nose is **medial** (closer to the midline) to your ears.

## Planes

Sections of the body (e.g. when taking a CT-scan) are also often referred to by
the plane in which the section is taking. There are three primary body planes.

- *Sagittal* - "back to front". Comes from the Latin word for "arrow" - think of an
  arrow travelling straight through your body shot by Sagittarius!
- *Coronal* - "left to right".
- *Transverse* - "top to bottom".
