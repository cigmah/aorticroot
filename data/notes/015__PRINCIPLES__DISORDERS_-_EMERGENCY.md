# How do I admit a patient?

- Patients are **admitted** to a hospital if they require inpatient tests,
  interventions or therapy.
- A comprehensive approach to admission is vital to avoid committing medical
  errors of omission. Harrison's Manual of Medicine suggests the mnemonic
  *ADMIT VITALS AND PHYSICAL EXAM* to remember them by heart, but electronic
  medical record software can also help you remember what you need to do.
  
  ```
 ADMIT VITALS AND PHYSICAL EXAM - admission checklist
                                          
 A      Admit to where and for what? e.g. medicine, ICUE for acute care/observation
 D      Diagnosis? (the current working one)                                       
 M      MDs - who was there at admission?
 I      Isolation requirements? e.g. contact isolation and why
 T      Telemetry required? What type of monitoring is required?
 
 V      Vital signs? How frequently do they need to be done? Do you need orthostatic vitals too?
 I      IV access achieved/needed? What fluid or TPN orders?
 T      Therapists needed? Respiratory, physical, occupational, speech etc. 
 A      Allergies? If so, what happens on exposure?
 L      Labs? What blood and other pathology tests do you need?
 S      Studies? What scans, ultrasounds etc. do you need?
 
 A      Activity - weight bearing, fall precautions
 N      Nursing orders - e.g. daily weights
 D      Dietary orders - e.g. NBM, tube, resuming diet
 
 P      Peptic ulcer prevention - e.g. PPI
 H      Heparin or other DVT prophylaxis
 Y      Yank catheters and other non-essential lines to prevent infection
 S      Skin care - prevention of pressure sores, wound care
 I      Incentive spirometry - prevent atelectasis and hospital-acquired pneumonia
 C      Calcium, Vitamin D, bisphosphonates - prevention of fractures, osteoporosis if steroids
 A      ACE inhibitors and aspirin - very useful for patients with coronary disease
 L      Lipids - conduct lipid panel for most patients with cardiovascular disease

 E      ECG for most patients >50 on admission
 X      X-rays: CXR, AXR, check line placements
 A      Advance directives: DNR? 
 M      Medications - be very specific 
  
```

- *When prescribing medications*, Harrison's also recommends the mnemonic *Stat
  DRIP* which you can use to help organise them by route of administration. Also
  consider PRN orders for paracetamol, stool softeners/laxatives and sleeping
  pills on advance. 
  
  ```
  Stat DRIP - types of medication orders
  
  Stat    Stat
  D       Daily (+ specify "first dose now" if necessary)
  R       "Round the clock"
  I       IV
  P       PRN
  
  ```
