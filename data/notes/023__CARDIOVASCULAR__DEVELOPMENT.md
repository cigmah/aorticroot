## When does the heart pump blood?

The heart develops early during foetal life, and begins pumping blood at
approximately 3 weeks of life or days 21-23. 

## From which germ layer does the heart develop from?

The heart develops from **mesoderm**. 

## How does the heart develop?

The *cardiogenic area* within the embryonic mesoderm responds to underlying
endodermal factors and forms two *cardiogenic cords*, which both soon develop a
lumen and become *endocardial tubes*. The two endocardial tubes then fuse to
become the *primitive heart tube*, which is divided into five separate sections:
the *truncus arteriosus*, the *bulbis cordis*, the *primitive ventricle*, the
*primitive atrium* and the *sinus venosus*.

     | Truncus arteriosus +---------> Aorta + Pulmonary Trunk
     +--------------------+
                         
     +--------------------+  becomes
     | Bulbis cordis      +---------> Right ventricle
     +--------------------+
                                                          
     +---------------------+ becomes 
     | Primitive ventricle +--------> Left ventricle
     +---------------------+
                                                                                  
     +---------------------+ becomes
     | Primitive atrium    +--------> Atria + appendages
     +---------------------+
                           
     +---------------------+ becomes
     | Sinus venosus       +--------> Right atrium + SA node + coronary sinus
     +---------------------+
