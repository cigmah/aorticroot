Haematology is the study of blood and blood-related disorders.

# Haematology Topics

A convenient way to split up haematology topics is by the "type of (mature) cell" - i.e.:

- **Red blood cells** - (*erythrocytes*) the cells which carry oxygen around the body.
- **White blood cells** - (*leukocytes*) the cells which fight infections and foreign invaders.
  - **Granulocytes** - immune cells which contain cytoplasmic granules which can be released against foreign invaders.
    - **Eosinophils** - cells primarily involved in protection against parasites and implicated in allergic reactions.
    - **Neutrophils** - (*polymorphs*, so-called because of their multi-lobular nuclei), which primarily act in acute infections (particularly bacterial).
    - **Basophils** - rarer cells involved in inflammatory reactions, often against parasites.
  - **Lymphocytes** - immune cells typically involved in the *adaptive* immune response providing specialised defences against pathogens.
    - **T-lymphocytes** - (aka *T cells*), includes cells which detect and propagate pathogen proteins to the immune system and kill infected cells.
    - **B-lymphocytes** - (aka *B cells*), includes cells which "store" memory of pathogens and produce specific antibodies against pathogens.
- **Platelets** - (*thrombocytes*) the "cells" (though they're more accurately described as cell fragments) which aggregate and provide scaffolding to clot blood when blood vessels break.

It's often useful to also relate these topics to the lineage of cells during *haematopoiesis*, which is the process where undifferentiated haematopoietic cells gradually become more and more specialised.
