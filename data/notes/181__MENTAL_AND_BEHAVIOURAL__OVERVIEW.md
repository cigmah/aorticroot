## What is positive psychology

Some definitions:

- **Psychopathology bias** (informally) refers to the focus on psychopathology -
i.e. mental *illness* - in the last century or so of medicine, the implication
being that general wellbeing has gone ignored.

- **Negativity bias** (more formally) refers to people's psychological
predilection towards focusing on negative emotions and stimuli (which probably
had a role in ensuring our early survival. 

- **Positive psychology** is a focus on positive well-being in contrast with
  the psychology of psychopathology. It combines old and new research, is a mix
  of both theory and application, is *complementary* to traditional
  psychopathology (i.e. not a replacement!) and is *not* a *Pollyanna* approach
  (i.e. it still recognises that unpleasant emotions are normal). 

- **Pollyanna** refers to a bias towards being optimistic and "happy-go-lucky".
  The word comes from a book called
  [Pollyanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollyanna) about a girl who is
  always happy.

- **Hedonic** approaches to wellbeing are constructed on attaining pleasure and
  avoiding pain. 
  
- **Eudaimonic** approaches to wellbeing are constructed on personal growth and
  human virtue. 
  
- **Snyder's Hope Model** - derived from
  [here](http://ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/@books1/Snyder_Hndbk_Positive_Psych/Snyder_Lopez_Handbook_of_Positive_Psychology.pdf#page=276),
  Snyder proposed a model of hope involving three elements:

  1. Goals - what's my target?
  2. Pathways - how do I get to my target?
  3. Agency - how can I motivate myself to reach my target?
  
  When you're hopeful, you have clear goals, concrete pathways and lots of
  motivation. When you're not, you have vague goals, unclear pathways and not
  much motivation.

  
  
Some statistics:

- Roughly **20%** of the population is "flourishing", according to [Keyes 2005](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.73.3.539).

### What determines happiness?

According to [Lyubormirsky et al
2005](http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/themes/sonjalyubomirsky/papers/LSS2005.pdf),
there are three primary factors which determine happiness:

```

 +-----------+         +----------------+
 | HAPPINESS |  ====   | 50% set range  |
 +-----------+         +----------------+
                       +--------------------------+
                       | 40% intentional activity |
                       +--------------------------+
                       +-------------------+
                       | 10% circumstances |
                       +-------------------+

```

- A **set range** of happiness contributing **50%**, which depends on our
  genetics and personality.
- **Intentional activity** contributing **40%**, which includes building
  positive emotions, engaging and finding meaning. This is quite a lot!
- **Circumstances** contributing **10%**, such as education, age, gender, social
  class, being married, having friends etc. This is a pretty small contribution
  compared to what you might think, the reason being that adaptation usually
  helps us reorient the impact of circumstances on our happiness beyond basic needs.

The moral is that **positive emotions** are a big influence on our happiness,
even though we may think our happiness is mostly guided by the actions or
circumstances around us.
There are putative effects of positive emotions which are reviewed
[here](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf) including on
improving work productivity, increasing longevity, experiencing fewer colds etc. 

### What are some actionables I can try to help increase positive emotions?

- A **gratitude journal** - writing down 2-3 things every day or week on what
  you are grateful for. The emphasis is to focus on recalling positive events,
  not negative events in your life.
- **Savouring** - *anticipatory* (think about future positive events like the
  MUMUS AXP), *mindfulness* (live in the moment) and *reminiscent* (remember
  great times like last year's MUMUS AXP)
- **Random acts of kindness** - e.g. smiling, helping out or volunteering. 
- [**Ikigai**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) - a Japanese word describing a sense of life worth living, which is
  the "reason why I wake up in the morning". Apparently [not having an ikigai
  increases your risk of all-cause
  mortality](https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0b013e31817e7e64).
