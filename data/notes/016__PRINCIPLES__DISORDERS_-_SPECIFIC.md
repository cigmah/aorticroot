# A Clinical Approach to Disorders

A common approach to thinking about medical disorders is to separate out
information by subtopics:

- **Epidemiology** - the context of the disorder in society, such as prevalence,
  trends and risk factors.
- **Aetiology** - the fundamental cause or causes of the disease.
- **Pathophysiology** - the breakdown in physiological mechanisms responsible
  for the disease.
- **Clinical Presentation** - the *signs* (observations on examination) and *symptoms*
  (what the patient reports) that a patient with the disorder may present with.
- **Investigations** - important investigations to confirm disease, assess
  disease, or rule out other disorders. 
- **Differentials** - disorders which may present similarly to the disorder and
  must be distinguished. 
- **Management** - the management steps to managing the disorder, including
  pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.
- **Prognosis** - the future outlook for the disorder once diagnosed.
